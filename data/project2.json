The scope of this research will be to develop the foundation for an integrated (wind, solar, and hydropower) high resolution (4 km or finer) national data set showing the potential future (through the end of the 21st century) changes in the distribution of renewable energy generation. UAlbany has led efforts in developing information that will facilitate meeting New York State’s goals and objectives in addressing climate change in the context of renewable energy generation (NYSERDA 2022). This work will provide a pathway for expanding such work nation-wide, through the IUCRC nexus of cooperation amongst academia, industry, state, and federal stakeholders."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Industry Need: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"With state and national goals of generating 50 - 100% of energy from renewable resources by 2050 (and a concomitant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions), it is crucial that high-resolution assessments of the potential influence of climate change on the integrated renewable energy resource on state, regional, and national scales is available for planning, policy, and development purposes. UAlbany investigators (led by Dr. Freedman), under the sponsorship NYSERDA, have already developed information that will facilitate meeting New York State’s goals and objectives in addressing climate change in the context of renewable energy generation12.

The scope of this research will be to develop the foundation for an integrated (wind, solar, and hydropower) high resolution (4 km or finer) national data set showing the potential future (through the end of the 21st century) changes in the distribution of renewable energy generation. UAlbany has led efforts in developing information that will facilitate meeting New York State’s goals and objectives in addressing climate change in the context of renewable energy generation (NYSERDA 2022). This work will provide a pathway for expanding such work nation-wide, through the IUCRC nexus of cooperation amongst academia, industry, state, and federal stakeholders."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Industry Need: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"An overarching goal of the proposed work will be to identify potential changes to the distribution of renewable energy resources in the US. Estimated uncertainties will be assessed using available historic data sets and the latest Earth System Model projections available from the International Panel on Climate Change Climate Model Inter-comparison Projects (Eyring et al. 2016; Taylor et al. 2012) and leveraging work done by Freedman et al. (2020). This will be accomplished using various modeling and statistical techniques (including the use of high-resolution mesoscale model and dynamic downscaling). Results will provide insight into how regional scale weather patterns influencing the nation’s climate regimes will be affected by climate change during the remainder of this century. Targeted users, such as utilities, federal and state agencies and authorities, local, state, and regional planners, and Independent System Operators, Regional Transmission Operators, and Balancing Authorities, will be able to leverage the unparalleled resources of the IUCRC to better understand how climate change will affect the availability and distribution of renewable energy resources."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Objectives: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"Gather and analyze existing databases and modeling sensitivity studies examining the effects of climate change on US renewable energy resources (leveraging the NYSERDA study). Identify Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 model members that can be used for downscale modeling runs for detection and attribution of potential trends in renewable energy resources (i.e., 100 m wind speed and surface irradiance. Set up and test downscaling modeling system (using the Weather Research and Forecast [WRF] modeling system)."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Methodology: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Deliverables: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"<b><a href=\"https://airtable.com/shroSfrNoQ5NbqI7I/tblvyrts4AhrQGpr1\">Click here to view a short video presentation and provide project feedback.</a></b>"},{"type":"p","content":"<b>RESEARCHERS:</b>"}],"members":[{"email":"rfovell@albany.edu","university":"UAlbany","projecttitle":{"Title":"Climate Change and Renewable Energy","Number":"Project2","LeadPI":"Dr. Jeff Freedman"},"name":"Dr. Rob Fovell","lastnameforsorting":"Fovell","project":"Project2","link":"researchers.html#RobFovell","PI":"No"},{"email":"jfreedman@albany.edu","university":"UAlbany","projecttitle":{"Title":"Climate Change and Renewable Energy","Number":"Project2","LeadPI":"Dr. Jeff Freedman"},"name":"Dr. Jeff Freedman","lastnameforsorting":"Freedman","project":"Project2","link":"researchers.html#JeffFreedman","PI":"Yes"},{"email":"marcello.graziano@uconn.edu","university":"UConn","projecttitle":{"Title":"Climate Change and Renewable Energy","Number":"Project2","LeadPI":"Dr. Jeff Freedman"},"name":"Dr. Macello Graziano","lastnameforsorting":"Graziano","project":"Project2","link":"researchers.html#MacelloGraziano","PI":"No"},{"email":"alang@albany.edu","university":"UAlbany","projecttitle":{"Title":"Climate Change and Renewable Energy","Number":"Project2","LeadPI":"Dr. Jeff Freedman"},"name":"Dr. Andrea Lang","lastnameforsorting":"Lang","project":"Project2","link":"researchers.html#AndreaLang","PI":"No"},{"email":"ekstern@albany.edu","university":"UAlbany","projecttitle":{"Title":"Climate Change and Renewable Energy","Number":"Project2","LeadPI":"Dr. Jeff Freedman"},"name":"Dr. Eric Stern","lastnameforsorting":"Stern","project":"Project2","link":"researchers.html#EricStern","PI":"No"},{"email":"ksulia@albany.edu","university":"UAlbany","projecttitle":{"Title":"Climate Change and Renewable Energy","Number":"Project2","LeadPI":"Dr. Jeff Freedman"},"name":"Dr. Kara Sulia","lastnameforsorting":"Sulia","project":"Project2","link":"researchers.html#KaraSulia","PI":"No"},{"email":"cthorncroft@albany.edu","university":"UAlbany","projecttitle":{"Title":"Climate Change and Renewable Energy","Number":"Project2","LeadPI":"Dr. Jeff Freedman"},"name":"Dr. Christopher Thorncroft ","lastnameforsorting":"Thorncroft ","project":"Project2","link":"researchers.html#ChristopherThorncroft","PI":"No"}]}

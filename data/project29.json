Days with calm weather conditions that do not impact operations are referred to as Blue Sky Days (BSD). Days with weather conditions that can cause power outages or significantly increased power demands are considered Grey Sky Days (GSD). While a variety of natural disasters and types of severe weather can cause impacts to utility operations, there are a small number of routinely observed weather variables that are typically used to identify a GSD. Typical variables include air temperature, sustained wind speed, wind gust speed, accumulated precipitation, number of lightning strikes, and more. While the same variables are used across the country, the thresholds associated with each variable can vary from region to region and company to company. Quantifying the number of GSD’s and analyzing the data for trends would be useful to the utilities industry for improving the planning around power outage restorations, as well as for comparing one region (or utility) to another. A clear understanding of the trends can also inform any future infrastructure designs and system hardening that utility companies may perform."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Industry Relevance:</b>"},{"type":"p","content":"Energy utilities and other organizations affected by outages (NYISO, etc)"},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Objectives:</b>"},{"type":"p","content":"1) Identify regions within the Northeast that may have similar thresholds for GSD’s.  \r\n2) Quantify the number and trend of GSD’s in recent years broken down by region. \r\n3) Create a simple tool for identifying GSD’s based on current observations or forecasted conditions"},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Researchers:</b>"}],"members":[]}

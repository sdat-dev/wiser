High temperatures in the summer can lead to increased demand for cooling and air conditioning, putting a strain on the energy grid. This can result in power outages and blackouts, which can be costly for both homeowners and businesses. On the other hand, low temperatures in the winter can lead to increased demand for heating, which can also put a strain on the energy grid. Nevertheless, extreme temperatures can also provide opportunities to improve the prospects of energy systems in urban areas. For example, during periods of high temperatures, the demand for cooling can be met using alternative energy sources such as solar power. This can help to reduce the dependence on traditional fossil fuels and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, during periods of low temperatures, the demand for heating can be met with renewable energy sources such as geothermal or biomass. This can also help to reduce the dependence on traditional fossil fuels and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Any state's sustainable energy system requires greener energy sources. Maintaining energy demand and supply stability is difficult. These energy systems change socio-economic, environmental, physical, cultural, governmental, and organizational structures."},{"type":"p","content":""},{"type":"p","content":"Several countries have adopted sustainable energy technology, which may affect urban change. Most research groups have designed and developed several hybrid renewable energy system models and attempted for technological, scientific, and industrial advances towards energy systems, but sustainable urban residential energy systems for metropolitan cities have received little attention. This plan aims to analyze the impact of intense temperatures on energy systems across urban areas in residential setups. The potential for sustainable urban residential energy systems is required to be examined. Several simulation and sensitivity analyses are expected to be accomplished to support the planning of sustainable urban energy systems in selected urban areas. The simulation results will also recognize the sustainable urban energy development barriers under several scenarios. Sustainable energy resources with a combination of problems and opportunities will benefit from effective energy policy implementation to optimize existing and future energy systems. These methods can be used to create an independent, self-sustaining, cleaner, and environmentally friendly energy system for complex grid infrastructure extensions. It will help stakeholders solve complicated urban sustainability concerns caused by energy shortages."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Researchers:</b>"}],"members":[]}

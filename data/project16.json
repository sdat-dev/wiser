Meanwhile, outage data is publicly available from the online outage maps of all the major energy utilities. The data files from these sites contain outage statistics at the county and municipality level, and sometimes include more granular levels (i.e. street), with a time resolution of 15 minutes or less. This data can be collected and combined into a dataset that contains outages for the vast majority of the northeastern US, while also incorporating critical real-time weather information. This combined dataset can be used for real-time situational awareness and analysis of past outage events."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Industry Relevance:</b>"},{"type":"p","content":"Energy utilities and other organizations affected by outages (such as NYISO, NYPA, etc)"},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Objectives:</b>"},{"type":"p","content":"Collect and organize a dataset of northeastern US power outages."},{"type":"p","content":"Create a web application for exploring the dataset alongside other relevant information identified by utility partners."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Researchers:</b>"}],"members":[{"email":"wmay@hey.com","university":"UAlbany","projecttitle":{"Title":"Northeastern US Outage Dataset and Web Application","Number":"Project16","LeadPI":"Nick Bassill"},"name":"Mr. William May","lastnameforsorting":"May","project":"Project16","link":"researchers.html#WilliamMay","PI":"No"}]}

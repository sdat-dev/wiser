The research spans a wide range of timescales from diurnal to multidecadal. At the weather scale, my research is focused on understanding the physical processed that impact the nature and variability of African easterly waves (AEWs). This includes a special emphasis on how AEWs interact with the ubiquitous mesoscale convective systems and ultimately how this affects the probability that AEWs will help spawn tropical cyclones. Recent work at the weather scale has also emphasized the role of convectively coupled equatorial waves on the West African monsoon and Atlantic tropical cyclogenesis frequency. At the climate scale, I am interested in better understanding the annual cycle of the West African monsoon as well as the processes that impact interannual to decadal variability and predictability of Sahel rainfall.","CV":"","UniversityInstitutionalPage":"https://www.albany.edu/daes/faculty/christopher-d-thorncroft","ResearchGate":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chris-Thorncroft-2","GoogleScholar":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=koTvwQgAAAAJ&hl=en","Others":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-thorncroft-00592961/","Project1":"Improving Outage Prediction by Utilizing Available Weather Networks and Utility Data","Project2":"Climate Change and Renewable Energy","Project3":"Vegetation Risk Analysis","Project4":"","Project5":"","Course1":"","Course2":"","Course3":"","Course4":"","Course5":"","ResearchAreas":["Climate Change","Outage Management"],"Photo":"cthorncroft@albany.edu.jpeg"},{"Title":"Dr. ","Email":"manos@engr.uconn.edu","LastName":"Anagnostou","FirstName":"Emmanouil ","PhoneNumber":"(860) 486-6806","JobTitle":"Eversource Energy Endowed Chair in Environmental Engineering & Eversource Energy Center Director  Civil & Environmental Engineering","UniversityInstitution":"UConn","UAlbanyCollegeSchoolDivision":"","UConnCollegeSchoolDivision":"School of Engineering","OtherUniversity":"","OtherCollegeSchoolDivision":"","Department":"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering","Keyword1":"","Keyword2":"","Keyword3":"","Keyword4":"","Keyword5":"","Keyword6":"","Keyword7":"","ResearchExpertise":"Dr. Anagnostou is a Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the Eversource Energy Endowed Chair in Environmental Engineering.

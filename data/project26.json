Traditional methods often rely on economic assumptions focused on supply, cost, and demand, without considering broader planning and stakeholder priorities and concerns in relation to long-term community energy goals. Coupled with new research at the Eversource Energy Center, our community-level investigation will allow for assessment of community variation that may affect decision-making preferences related to grid resiliency and energy demand and infrastructure."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Industry Relevance:</b>"},{"type":"p","content":"1) This study will further interpret the forecast mode OPM outputs by considering model uncertainties with different weather forecast lead times. Understanding the quality of longer lead-time forecasts will particularly be useful to support utility preparedness for major storms.  \r\n2) The trends of OPM forecast skill may vary for different storm types (i.e. rain and wind events, thunderstorms, snow and ice events). These results will guide the future direction of the OPM continuous development plan."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Objectives:</b>"},{"type":"p","content":"1) Evaluate the uncertainty of weather variables with different forecast lead-times for different storm types. \r\n2) Evaluate the skill of the outage prediction model from different weather forecast lead-times for different storm types. \r\n3) Assess the error propagated from weather forecasts to outage predictions."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Researchers:</b>"}],"members":[]}

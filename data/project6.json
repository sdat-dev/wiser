In addition to frequent uncertainty regarding exact weather impacts, a variety of ancillary factors directly modulate these decisions. These may be utility-centric factors such as staffing readiness, crew positioning, mutual assistance demands and availability, or situational factors such as vegetation or ease of transportation. As an event unfolds, these factors must further be incorporated into decisions based on real-time situational awareness of where the weather is impacting, and how it may differ from expectations. Successfully navigating these disparate data sources can be the difference in timely restoration, efficiency, and cost savings. However, realizing these benefits requires a clear understanding of how to obtain this information efficiently, how these pieces connect to one another, and what actions are most likely to succeed. One critical need is an easier way to interpret and visualize probabilistic forecasts. We propose to build a data management framework, which leverages close coordination with member partners and utilities and results in visualization tools, to concisely display and incorporate all relevant operational information – (integrated meteorological and operational information) such as human resource staffing, logistical systems, and other enterprise resource planning systems) to support utilities in making the most effective decisions."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Industry Need: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"More accurate forecasts and realistic depictions of the met-ocean environment are necessary for more reliable assessments of energy production and load matching potential, and for project planning and financing, and providing real time estimates of loads on exposed and rotating hardware components and will safeguard vessel and labor operations (see e.g., Colle et al. 2016). Additionally, extreme event forecasting (e.g., Nor’easters) will support better predictions of ramp events resulting from turbine high-wind de-rates and cut-outs."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Objectives: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"First, develop a platform to integrate disparate data sources for query and display. This platform will be comprised of static and dynamic data sources. This will be done in close coordination with member utilities that will then utilize this platform to power real-time outage management decision-making, such as staffing decisions and pre-deployment strategies."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Methodology: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"We will identify external data sources as well as key stakeholders within member utilities. The external data sources will include: (a) real-time weather data, such as the data provided by NOAA and the NYS Mesonet; (b) available outage prediction and/or weather prediction models; (c) static metadata, including utility infrastructure, tree cover, crew, and fleet information, etc.,   (d) historical data, such as weather archives and outage histories, and ongoing wildfires and wildfire risk. Second, develop an integrated platform to combine and query multiple data sources, with visualization created with input from utility stakeholders. Finally, develop AI-based suggested decision-making tools for staffing and pre-deployment strategies for forecast outage events and integrate them into the visualization platform."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Deliverables: </b>"},{"type":"ul","content":"dot-list","source":"ul","logo":"dot-list","subcontent":"ul","style":"dot-list"},{"type":"li","content":"AI-based software (where AI is appropriate) available for use by utilities to aid in decision-making for managing power outages.","source":"li","logo":"Milestone 1 (year 1; months 1 - 6): Review previous studies, literature, and ongoing Freedman et al.
